Toolkit
=======

Toolkit is a Java library that makes it easy to perform common mathematical functions, and adds a Vector2 class.

Features
--------
  - Convert angles from degrees/radians to Vector2 and back
  - LERP between numbers/colors
  - An easier to use random number generator


How to use
----------

The easiest way to use Toolkit is add it as a dependency in your `pom.xml` file. As I don't have it in a central maven repo, you will need to add [my repo](https://github.com/Talon876/repo) as well.

Add Toolkit as a dependency:

    <dependencies>
        [...]
        <dependency>
    		<groupId>org.nolat</groupId>
			<artifactId>toolkit</artifactId>
			<version>1.0</version>
		</dependency>
    </dependencies>
